# HumRaahi

This is a community-based carpooling application made using flutter and firebase.
This is not a perfect project, so expect some minor issues as I have not added comments or much better file names yet.

Remember to use your own google-services.json file, as well add your API key to the following files:

#### -local.properties

#### -assistantMethods.dart

#### -search_screen.dart
